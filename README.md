# carpark-data
First Github Actions mini project.

This repository pulls data from https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/transport/carpark-availability every hour. Data is stored in /data. 


## Future Developments
- Parse data from /data to create a master file for each carpark.
- Automate a graph from the data that updates over time.
